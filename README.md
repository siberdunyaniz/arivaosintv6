   - `2` for Turkish

2. **Main Menu**
   After selecting a language, the main menu will display the following options:
   - `1. IP Address Info + GeoIP`: Perform an IP address lookup.
   - `2. Phone Number Info`: Lookup details for a phone number.
   - `3. WHOIS Lookup`: Query WHOIS data for a domain.
   - `4. Random Password Generator`: Generate a secure password.
   - `5. Exit`: Quit the tool.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while installing or running ARIVA OsintV6, try the following:

- **Dependency Installation Fails**
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
  - Manually install dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests phonenumbers ipwhois whois fake_useragent pystyle
    ```
  - For Termux, ensure storage permissions are granted.

- **Module Not Found Error**
  - Run the tool again; it will attempt to reinstall missing modules.
  - Alternatively, install the missing module manually (e.g., `pip install <module_name>`).

- **API Request Errors**
  - Some lookups (e.g., IP geolocation) require internet access. Verify your connection.
  - Check if the API services (e.g., ipapi.co) are operational.

- **Tool Crashes**
  - Ensure you are using Python 3.x (check with `python3 --version`).
  - Update your Python environment and dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade requests phonenumbers ipwhois whois fake_useragent pystyle
    ```
